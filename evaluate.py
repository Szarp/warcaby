# Heuristics could also consider sums of or differences in respective parameters for both
# players rather than raw numbers for each player separately. Once heuristics using the
# straightforward parameters listed above had been generated and tested, it was decided
# that it would be desirable to add more sophisticated parameters characterizing layout of
# the pieces on the board. The following parameters were, therefore, introduced:
# 9. Number of defender pieces2 (i.e. the ones situated in two lowermost rows);
# def defender_pieces(self):
#     pass
# 10. Number of attacking pawns (i.e. positioned in three topmost rows);
# def attacking_pieces(self):
#     pass
# 11. Number of centrally positioned pawns (i.e. situated on the eight central squares of the board);
# def central_pawns(self):
#     pass
# 12. Number of centrally positioned kings;
# def central_queens(self):
#     pass
# 13. Number of pawns positioned on the main diagonal;
# def main_diagonal_pawns(self):
#     # x == (BOARD_HEIGHT-y)
#     pass
# 14. Number of kings positioned on the main diagonal;
# def main_diagonal_queens(self):
#     pass
# 15. Number of pawns situated on double diagonal;
# def double_diagonal_pawns(self):
#     pass
# 16. Number of kings situated on double diagonal;
# def double_diagonal_queens(self):
#     pass
# 17. Number of loner pawns. Loner piece is defined as the one not adjacent to any other
# def loner_pawns(self):
#     pass
# 18. Number of loner kings;
# def loner_kings(self):
#     pass
# 19. Number of holes, i.e. empty squares adjacent to at least three pieces of the same color.
# Apart from the above parameters six patterns were defined. They are described below
# using common notation presented in Fig. 2. Since only one instance of each pattern can
# exist for any of the players at the same time, features 20âˆ’ 25 can take only boolean values.
# 20. Presence of a Triangle pattern(see Fig. 3(a)).
# 21. Presence of an Oreo pattern (see Fig. 3(b)).
# 22. Presence of a Bridge pattern (see Fig. 3(c)).
# 23. Presence of a Dog pattern (see Fig. 3(d)).
# 24. Presence of a pawn in corner (i.e. White (Black) pawn on square 29 (4), resp.);
# 25. Presence of a king in corner (i.e. White (Black) king on square 4 (29), resp.);
